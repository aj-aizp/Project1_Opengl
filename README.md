### Project 1 OpenGL 

My first project using OpenGl and GLSL for graphics programming. Learned the basics of the graphics pipeline and shader programming. 

Main source code is in first.cpp and the vertex/fragment shaders are found in .txt files. 

Would like to credit learnopengl.com for the tutorials and resources.
